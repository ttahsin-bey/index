[{"body":"What you’ll need Parts Caution The project is under active development and not all materials will be in sync. Please ensure that you’ve done some research to ensure you select the appropriate model, BOM, hardware, firmware and software combination.  To build your own index you will need to acquire the items listed on the BOM. This includes various mechanical components along with a significant number of 3D printed parts. When printing the 3d parts, be sure to print them with the recommended settings.\nTools The following tools are needed to build the Index.\n 2mm Allen Key 2.5mm Allen Key 3mm Allen Key 4mm Allen Key Fine Tip Tweezers (for positioning T-Nuts) Pliers / Vice Grips Utility Knife / Precision Blade  Tips \u0026 Tricks When assembling the Index, the following tips will help the process go more smoothly.\n Clean up your 3D prints well. Make sure that you have removed any support material, and have cleaned up the edges of any holes. Test that you can fit the V-Slot or machine screw for a specific part into the hole. Deburr the aluminum profile at the ends. Then it’s easier to put parts together. Slot Nuts come in two different formats. One form can be inserted into the slot through the slot. The other form must be inserted from the end. Watch for notes in the about when to insert based on which type you’re using. Positioning Slot Nuts can be a bit of a challenge. A simple way to get them into the right place is to use gravity to get them close, and then use either the long end an allen key or a pair of fine tipped tweezers to push or pull them to the exact position. Inserting Belts can be easier if you move the gantry you’re inserting the belt into to the middle of the rail it is on and then as you insert the belt, move it away from the side you want the belt to come out from. The v-slot will catch the belt and once you’ve moved the gantry a little bit, you will be able to catch the belt. Passing a belt through a belt slot from the inner side can be easier if you place an exacto knife blade at the back side of the slot and butt the belt against that while drawing it up through the slot. Press Fit Nuts are used in several places. If your printer tolerances make it so these nuts don’t stay in you can use a piece of tape over the back to hold them in temporarily.

Assembly Take the Left Back Leg and insert the v-slot extrusions into the two square holes designed to take this part. Ensure that the extrusion comes to the end of the hole into which it is inserted.    If using slot nuts which must be inserted from the end of the extrusion, take the assembly and turn it so that you are looking directly at the ends of the v-slot opposite to the attached Left Back Leg. Otherwise, continue to step 11 and note if a step says you must insert slot nuts.     Insert two slot nuts into the top slot of the top rail (label A) from the open end.    Insert two slot nuts into the top slot on the bottom rail (label E) from the open end. Note: These will be used later when joining the two side assemblies.    Insert one slot nut into the right slot on the bottom rail (label F) from the open end.    Insert three slot nuts into the left slot of the bottom rail (label H) from the open end.     Take the Left Front Leg and place it onto two v-slot extrusions at the end opposite the Left Back Leg. Your progress should look like the image below.    On the top rail, position a slot nut underneath the hole in the top of each leg and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into the nut. If using slot nuts which can be inserted into the slot, you will need to insert two nuts during this step.

Take a V-slot extrusion and insert a T-nut into one end.    Affix a 2020 corner bracket to the end of the V-slot using the T-Nut inserted in the previous step.    Repeat the previous two steps three times to install three more braces.    Insert two T-Nuts into the left side    Position the two T-Nuts to match with the braces installed in the previous 4 steps.    Using two M5x8mm screws, fasten the left side of the rear brace (from steps 17-19) to the left side using the T-Nuts installed and positioned in the previous two steps.    Insert two T-Nuts into the right side    Position the two T-Nuts to match with the braces installed in steps 17-19.    Using two M5x8mm screws, fasten the right side of the rear brace (from steps 17-19) to the right side using the T-Nuts installed and positioned in the previous two steps.    Place the staging plate onto the frame and adjust the T-Nuts. This uses the nuts installed in the left and right side assembly stage. If using slot nuts which can be inserted into the slot, you will need to insert four nuts during this step.    Fasten the staging plate using a four M5x8mm machine screws, one in each corner.    Note The frame needs to be square for the gantry to work properly. When the gantry is installed, you will want to adjust the plate and back cross-piece to ensure that the frame is square.

This setting caused issues, at least for some users. After disabling it, uploading via PIO worked.\nThings to check if the board doesn’t show up as “STM32 BOOTLOADER”:  Check if the USB hub works by connecting devices to other ports. This is not an absolute guarantee that the connection to the STM32 works though. Check if all solder joints look fine Check if all necessary voltages are present (Mobo input voltage, 5V rail and 3.3V rail) Keep in mind that a blank STM32 should still appear as a USB device, even if it has no firmware loaded onto it Check the 8MHz crystal oscillator of the SMT32. Its correct operation is important for DFU. Wrong frequency and / or incorrect load capacitors can cause issues. Use an oscilloscope to probe the signal. You should see a smooth sine wave with stable frequency.  Alternative method to upload: This method requires an ST-Link (V2 Clone or equivalent). Additionally you need the software STM32CubeProgrammer by ST. This method is a bit more involved and takes longer than just using the DFU mode.\n  Compile (build) the project normally with PIO\n  This generates a .bin-file that contains the firmware\n  Connect your board to your ST-Link through the SWD header on board\n  Start STM32CubeProgrammer\n  Connect to the MCU:     Click on Open file and navigate to the firmware.bin file in PROJECT_DIRECTORY/.pio/build/STM32F407VE_black     Click on Download.
